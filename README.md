# KAGE-Quest

## Introduction
The KAGE quest project uses shark attack data found at [sharkattack] (https://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm).
As a group we performed data wrangling, data cleaning, and data viualizations to answer a business question. 

## About the dataset
The shark data set consisted of global shark attacks. Shark attacks in this data set dated back to 1555 where the only information provided was that it was a male named Olaus Magnus. The data set contains both categorical and numerical variables. Variable that were utilized for out aalysis were location and state.

##Business Question
We want to start a shark excursion business where thrill junkies can get in a KAGE and be up close and personal with various types of sharks. We used the shark data set to find the state and specific location that our business would thrive. By cleaning the data we were able to find that KAGE will do very well in New Smyrna Beach, Florida.
